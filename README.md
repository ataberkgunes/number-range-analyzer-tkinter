# Number Range Analyzer (Python – Tkinter)

This project is a **GUI-based number analysis tool** developed using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library.  
It allows users to analyze numbers within a given range and perform various mathematical operations through an intuitive graphical interface.

---

## Project Overview

The application takes a **start** and **end** number from the user and provides different analyses such as listing numbers, finding divisible numbers, and identifying prime numbers.  
It is designed as a practical project to demonstrate **GUI programming**, **user input validation**, and **basic algorithmic logic** in Python.
